# The Ball

### 3:1
The game is played with a round, non-slippery rubber ball. The men’s
ball weighs 350 to 370 grams and has a circumference of 54 to 56
centimetres; the women’s ball weighs 280 to 300 grams and has a
circumference of 50 to 52 centimetres. A smaller ball may be used for
children’s games.

### 3:2 
Prior to each game at least 4 regulation balls must be available. The 2
reserve balls should be kept in the middle behind each goal in a
designated area and the 3rd reserve ball should be kept at the
timekeeper’s table

### 3:3 
In order to minimize any playing time interruptions and avoid timeouts, the goalkeeper indicated by the referee should bring a
replacement ball into the play as quickly as possible, when the ball has left the playing court.
