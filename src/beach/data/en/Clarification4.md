## 4. Passive Play  (Rule [7:10-11](#7:10))

### A. General Guidelines

The application of the rules regarding passive play has the objective of
preventing unattractive methods of play and intentional delays in the game.
This requires that the referees throughout the game recognize and judge
passive methods in a consistent manner.

Passive methods of play may arise in all phases of a team's attack, i.e.
when the ball is moved down the court, during the build-up phase or during
the finishing phase.

Passive ways of playing may be used relatively more frequently in the
following situations:
- A team is narrowly in the lead towards the end of the game;
- A team has a player suspended;
- Numerical superiority of a team, especially in defence.

### B. The Utilisation of the Forewarning Signal 

The forewarning signal should be shown particularly in the following situations:

#### B1. When substitutions are made slowly or when the ball is moved slowly down the court.

Typical indications are:

- Players are standing around in the middle of the court waiting for
substitutions to be completed;
- The player is standing still bouncing the ball;
- The ball is played back into the team's own half of the court, even
though the opponents are not putting on any pressure;
- Delays in the execution of the goalkeeper throw or any other throw.
  
#### B2. In connection with a late substitution after the build-up phase has already started.

Typical indications are:

- All players have already taken up their attacking positions;
- The team starts the build-up phase with a preparatory passing
play;
- Not until this stage does the team undertake a substitution.

***Comment:***

The team which has attempted a rapid counter-attack from its own half of
the court, but has failed to get to an immediate scoring opportunity after
reaching the opponents’ half of the court, must be allowed to undertake a
quick substitution of players at that stage.

#### B3. During an excessively long build-up phase

In principle, the team must always be allowed a build-up phase with a
preparatory passing play before they can be expected to start a targeted
attacking situation.

Typical indications of an excessively long build-up phase are:
- The team's attack does not lead to any targeted attacking action.

***Comment:***

“Targeted attacking action” exists particularly when the attacking team uses
tactical methods to move in such way that it gains spatial advantage over
the defenders, or when they increase the pace of the attack in comparison
with the build-up phase.
- Players are repeatedly receiving the ball while standing still or
moving away from the goal;
- Repeated bouncing of the ball while standing still;
- When confronted by an opponent, the attacking player turns away
prematurely, waits for the referees to interrupt the game or gains
no spatial advantage over the defender;

- Active defensive actions: Active defensive methods preventing the
attackers from increasing the pace because the defenders block
the intended ball movements and running paths;
- The attacking team achieves no clear increase in pace from the
build-up phase to the finishing phase.


#### B4. After showing the forewarning signal

After showing the forewarning signal, the referees should allow the team in
possession of the ball some time to change their action. (The referees
should recognize and allow that younger players and teams at lower levels
may require more time.) If after this build-up phase there is no clear
increase in pace and no targeted attacking action can be recognized, then
the referees must conclude that the team in possession of the ball is guilty
of passive play.

***Comment:***
The referees must be careful not to take action against passive play
precisely at the moment when the attacking team is actually trying to shoot
or undertake a move against the goal of the opponents.

### C. The Utilisation of the Forewarning Signal 
The forewarning signal should be shown particularly in the following
situations:

#### C1. When substitutions are made slowly or when the ball is moved slowly down the court.
Typical indications are:
- Players are standing around in the middle of the court waiting for
substitutions to be completed;
- The player is standing still bouncing the ball;
- The ball is played back into the team's own half of the court, even
though the opponents are not putting on any pressure;
- Delays in the execution of the goalkeeper throw or any other throw.

#### C2. In connection with a late substitution after the build-up phase has already started.
Typical indications are:
- All players have already taken up their attacking positions;
- The team starts the build-up phase with a preparatory passing
play;
- Not until this stage does the team undertake a substitution.

***Comment:***
The team which has attempted a rapid counter-attack from its own half of
the court, but has failed to get to an immediate scoring opportunity after
reaching the opponents’ half of the court, must be allowed to undertake a
quick substitution of players at that stage.

#### C3. During an excessively long build-up phase.
In principle, the team must always be allowed a build-up phase with a
preparatory passing play before they can be expected to start a targeted
attacking situation.

Typical indications of an excessively long build-up phase are:
- The team's attack does not lead to any targeted attacking action.

***Comment:***
“Targeted attacking action” exists particularly when the attacking team uses
tactical methods to move in such way that it gains spatial advantage over
the defenders, or when they increase the pace of the attack in comparison
with the build-up phase.

- Players are repeatedly receiving the ball while standing still or
moving away from the goal;
- Repeated bouncing of the ball while standing still;
- When confronted by an opponent, the attacking player turns away

no spatial advantage over the defender;
- Active defensive actions: Active defensive methods preventing the

- The attacking team achieves no clear increase in pace from the
build-up phase to the finishing phase.

#### C4. After showing the forewarning signal
After showing the forewarning signal, the referees should allow the team in
possession of the ball some time to change their action. (The referees
should recognize and allow that younger players and teams at lower levels
may require more time.) If after this build-up phase there is no clear
increase in pace and no targeted attacking action can be recognized, then
the referees must conclude that the team in possession of the ball is guilty
of passive play.

***Comment:***
The referees must be careful not to take action against passive play
precisely at the moment when the attacking team is actually trying to shoot
or undertake a move against the goal of the opponents.

### D. How the forewarning signal should be shown

If a referee (either the court referee or the goal-line referee) recognizes the
emergence of passive play, he lifts the arm ([Hand Signal No.16](#16---forewarning-signal-for-passive-play)) to indicate
the judgment that the team is not trying to get into a position to take a shot
on goal. The second referee should also give the forewarning signal.

The forewarning signal conveys that the team in possession is not making
any attempt to create a scoring opportunity, or that it is repeatedly delaying
the restart of the game.

The hand signal is maintained until:
- The attack is over; or
- The forewarning signal is no longer valid (see advice below).

An attack begins when the team gets into possession of the ball, and is
considered over when the team scores a goal or loses possession.

The forewarning signal normally applies to the entire remainder of the
attack. However, during the course of an attack, there are two situations
where the judgment of passive play is no longer valid and the forewarning
signal is to be stopped:
- a) The team in possession takes a shot on goal and the ball rebounds to
the team from the goal or the goalkeeper (directly or in the form of a throwin);
- b) A player or team official of the defending team is given a personal
punishment under Rule 16 due to a foul or unsportsmanlike conduct.

In these two situations, the team in possession must be allowed a new
build-up phase.

If the attacking team were to request a team time-out after the forewarning
signal has been shown, then the forewarning signal should be shown again
when the game is being restarted after the team time-out in order to
emphasize that the warning is still in effect.
