## 8. Interruption by the timekeeper (Rule [18:1](#18:1))

If a timekeeper interrupts the game due to a faulty substitution or illegal
entry under Rules [4:4](#4:4), [4:6](#4:6), [4:13](#4:13), [4:14](#4:14) the game is restarted with a free
throw for the opponents, normally at the place of the infringement. If,
however, the ball was at a more favourable position for the opponents at
the time of the interruption, then the free throw should be taken from that
place (see Rule [13:8](#13:8), 3rd and 4th paragraphs).

In the case of such infringements, the timekeeper shall interrupt the game
immediately, without regard to the general “advantage rules” in Rules [13:2](#13:2)
and [14:2](#14:2). If a clear scoring chance is destroyed because of such an
interruption, when it is caused by an infringement on the part of the
defending team, then a 6-metre throw shall be awarded in accordance with
Rule [14:1a](#14:1).

In the event of other types of infringements that need to be reported to the
referees, the timekeeper should generally wait until the next interruption of
the game.

If the timekeeper nevertheless interrupts the game, such an intervention
cannot lead to a loss of possession. The game will be restarted with a free
throw for the team which had possession at the time of the interruption. If,
however, the interruption was caused by an infringement on the part of the
defending team, and the referees judge that the premature interruption
destroyed a clear chance of scoring for the opponents, then a 6-metre
throw shall be awarded in analogy with Rule [14:1b](#14:1). As a general principle,
infringements observed and reported by the timekeeper/scorekeeper
(except as mentioned under Rules [4:4](#4:4), [4:6](#4:6), [4:13](#4:13), [4:14](#4:14)) do not lead to
personal punishments.

The provision for awarding a 6-metre throw in accordance with Rule [14:1a](#14:1),
as indicated in the second paragraph above, applies also if a referee or
technical delegate (from the IHF or a Continental/National Federation)
interrupts the game for an infringement leading to a verbal warning or a
punishment against a player or an official of the defending team, at a
moment when the team in possession has a clear chance of scoring.
