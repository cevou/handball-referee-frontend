**Edition: 1 July 2019**

The PRC in collaboration with the IHF rules experts have discussed several different topics in relation with rules
interpretations and agreed to publish a new version of the Guidelines and Interpretations with the intention of
clarifying the correct decisions on certain situations.

There are some new Guidelines and some updated versions of the previous Guidelines from the editions of 1 July 2016 and
1 July 2018.

This new version of the Guidelines and Interpretations is valid as of 1 July 2019.

## Last 30 seconds rule

Rules [8:10c](#8:10) and [8:10d](#8:10) were modified in 2016 with the aim of preventing certain unsportsmanlike player
behaviours in the last moments of matches from giving the guilty player’s team the opportunity to win the match. At the
same time, these rules facilitate the losing team’s chance to score one or more goals, while keeping the attention of
the spectators until the last second of the game.

Under Rule [8:10c](#8:10), a player or team official who prevented or delayed the execution of a throw in the last
moments was punished with a 7-metre throw, and under Rule [8:10d](#8:10), a 7-metre throw was given against the team of
which a player or official received a disqualification for an action with the ball in play in the last seconds. The
latter did not pose major interpretation difficulties.

Rule [8:10c](#8:10) was applicable only when the ball was not in play and a defender prevented or delayed the execution
of a throw. But that rule has led to erroneous interpretations by referees, players and other handball stakeholders, as
well as to identifying certain very unsportsmanlike behaviours that could not be properly punished according to the
current wording of this rule, allowing the team of the offender to win the match and giving a bad image to handball.

For this reason, the IHF, through the Game and Rules Development Working Group (GRDWG), formerly New Rules Working Group
(NRWG), from the Playing Rules and Referees Commission (PRC) and the Commission of Coaching and Methods (CCM), decided
to make a slight change in the interpretation of this rule by updating the existing Guideline of ‘not respecting the
distance (Rule [8:10c](#8:10))’, including an additional interpretation when the 7-metre and disqualification also
applies during an execution if an active illegitimate action from a defender occurs during the execution of the throw
as follows:

### 2018 – Update to the existing Guideline
#### Not respecting the distance (Rule 8:10c)

‘Not respecting the distance’ leads to a disqualification and 7-metre throw, if a throw during the last 30 seconds of
the game cannot be executed. The Rule is applicable if the infraction is committed during the last 30 seconds of the
game or at the same time as the final signal (see Rule [2:4](#2:4), 1st paragraph). In this case, the referees will
decide on the basis of their observations of facts (Rule [17:11](#17:11)).

If the game is interrupted during the last 30 seconds due to an interference that is not directly related to the
preparation or the execution of a throw (for example faulty substitution, unsportsmanlike conduct in the substitution
area), Rule [8:10c](#8:10) is to be applied.

If the throw, for example, is executed but blocked by a player standing too close and actively destroying the result of
the throw or disturbing the thrower during the execution, Rule [8:10c](#8:10) must also be applied.

If a player is standing less than three metres from the thrower but does not actively interfere with the execution,
there will be no punishment. If the player standing too close uses this position to block the shot or intercept the pass
from the thrower, Rule [8:10c](#8:10) also applies.

### 2019 – New Guideline
#### Rule 2:5

If the goalkeeper is injured in connection with a free throw after the final signal, the defending team is permitted to
substitute the goalkeeper. This exception is not applicable to defensive field players.

### 2019 – New Guideline
#### Free throw after final signal (Rules 2:6 and 8:10c)

In case of infractions or unsportsmanlike conduct by defenders during the execution of a free throw or 7-metre throw
after the final signal, these defenders must be punished personally under Rules [16:3](#16:3), [16:6](#16:6) or
[16:9](#16:9). The throw has to be repeated (Rule [15:9](#15:9), paragraph 3). Rule [8:10c](#8:10) is not applicable in
such cases.

### 2019 – New Guideline
#### Rule 3:3

The IHF, Continental Confederations and National Federations have the right to allow the use of reserve balls that are
not placed at the timekeeper’s table. The use of a reserve ball is decided by the referees according to Rule [3:4](#3:4).

### 2019 – New Guideline
#### Rules 4:7-4:9

The IHF, Continental Confederations and National Federations have the right to allow technical equipment in the
substitution area. The equipment has to be used in a fair manner, and it does not include equipment for communication
with a suspended official or player.

### 2018 – Update to the existing Guideline
#### Assisting injured players (Rule 4:11)

In cases where several players of the same team have been injured (for example, due to a collision), the referees or the
delegate may give permission for additional eligible persons to enter the court to assist those players, with a maximum
of two persons per injured player. In addition, the referees and the delegate monitor paramedics who may enter the
court.

### 2018 – New Guideline
#### Passive play count of passes (Rule 7:11 Clarification 4 Appendix 3, examples 13/14)

It is counted as a pass, if a shot on goal is blocked and the ball returns to the thrower or a teammate.

### 2018 – New Guideline
### 2019 – Update to the existing Guideline
#### Disqualification of the goalkeeper according to Rule 8:5 Comment

This applies when the goalkeeper comes from within the goal area or is in a similar position outside the goal area and
causes a frontal collision with an opponent. It does not apply when:

- a) the goalkeeper runs in the same direction as an opponent, for example, after reentering the court from the
  substitution area.
- b) the attacker runs after the ball, and the ball is between the attacker and the goalkeeper.

In such situations, the referees take a decision based on their observations of facts.

### 2018 – New Guideline
#### 7-metre decision with empty goal (Rule 14:1 and Clarification 6c)

The definition of a clear chance of scoring in situations described in Clarification 6c when there is a clear and
unimpeded opportunity to throw the ball into the empty goal requires that the player has possession of the ball and
clearly attempts to shoot directly at the empty goal. This definition of a clear chance of scoring applies regardless of
the type of violation and whether the ball is in or out of play, and any throw is to be executed from a correct position
of the thrower and teammates.

### 2018 – New Guideline
#### Use of video proof

When a goal/no-goal decision is required after the use of the video proof technology, there will be an extended deadline
for disallowing a goal, which under Rule [9:2](#9:2) is only until the subsequent throw-off has been taken, extending
this limitation until the next change of ball possession.

### 2018 – New Guideline
#### Player entering with wrong colour or number (Rules 4:7 and 4:8)

An infringement regarding Rules [4:7](#4:7) and [4:8](#4:8) will not lead to a change of ball possession. It will only
lead to the interruption of the game to order the player to correct the mistake and restart with a throw for the team
which were in possession of the ball.

###2019 – New Guideline
#### Rule 16:9d

If a player, after receiving a disqualification, is guilty of extremely unsportsmanlike conduct due to rule
[8:10a](#8:10), the player is punished with an additional disqualification with a written report, and the team is
reduced by one player for 4 minutes.

### 2019 – New Guideline
#### Goals anti-overturn (Rule 1:2)

The goals must be firmly attached to the floor or the walls behind them, or provided with an anti-overturn system. This
new provision is approved with the objective to avoid accidents.
