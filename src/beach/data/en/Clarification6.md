## 6. Seriously unsportsmanlike conduct (Rules [8:6](#8:6), [16:6e](#16:6))

Examples of seriously unsportsmanlike conduct are:
- a) Insulting behaviour (through speech, facial expressions, gestures or
body contact) directed at another person (referee, timekeeper/
scorekeeper, delegate, team official, player, spectator etc.);
- b) Throwing or pushing the ball away after a decision by the referees if
the ball goes so far that the action cannot be seen as just
unsportsmanlike conduct;
- c) If the goalkeeper demonstrates such a passive attitude when a 6-metre
throw has been awarded to the opponent that the referee must assume
that he is not trying to stop the shot;
- d) Taking revenge after having been fouled (hitting back in a reflex
action);
- e) Deliberately throwing the ball at an opponent during a stoppage in the
game unless it is done in such a way that it must be regarded as an
assault.
