# Sand Quality and Lighting Regulations

## Sand quality requirements in Beach Handball

Sand selection is probably the most important factor in court construction.
The sand should be sifted to an acceptable size and has to be not too
coarse, free of stones and dangerous particles. It should not be too fine to
cause dust and stick to the skin.

Any sand that is used should incorporate the following specifications:
- Washed: The sand should be double washed and free of silt and
clay in order to prevent compaction.
- Particle size: The size of the sand particles should be between 0.5
and 1 millimetre to allow for proper drainage and maximum safety.
- Particle shape: A sub angular shape will resist compaction and
assist the drainage.
- Color: Tan coloured sand absorbs less heat with minimal glare.
- Source: A granite-based sand (non-calcareous - no calcium or
limestone) remains stable under all weather conditions and is
unaffected by acid rain.

For high-quality Beach Handball sand the following formula should be followed:

|Name | Particle diameter | Specifications (% retention in sieves)|
|----|------------------|-------------|
|Fine gravel |2.0mm |0%|
|Very coarse sand |1.0mm - 2.0mm |0% - 6%|
|Coarse sand |0.5mm - 1.0mm |min. 80%|
|Medium sand |0.25mm - 0.5mm |max. 92%|
|Fine sand |0.15mm - 0.25mm |7% - 18%|
|Very fine sand |0.05mm - 0.15mm |not greater than 2.0%|
|Silt and clay |below 0.05mm |not greater than 0.15%|

## Lighting requirements in Beach Handball
If play is to take place at night, the court area should be illuminated to allow
players, officials and those watching both at the grounds and at home on
television to see the action clearly. This means the levels of brightness,
contrast and glare must be correctly designed over the entire playing area.
Lighting levels depend also on the size of the venue.

In case of international night competition, artificial lighting of 1 000 to 1 500
lux (minimum) measured at 1 metre above the playing surface must be
available. Artificial light may also be operating during daytime - upon
television request - in order to reduce the impact of the shadow. 

Indicative minimum lighting (lux) levels:
Training: 120 lux
Local competition: up to 400 lux
International competition: 1 000 to 1 500 lux
