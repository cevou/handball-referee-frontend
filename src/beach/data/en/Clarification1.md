## 1. Awarding of Points (Rule [9](#9))

**Also in the following scoring situation two points are awarded.**
A goal scored in “in-flight” (Rule [9:2](#9:2)).

Two points are awarded only if the player who is in-flight controls the ball and shots on goal while in the air (“slap” the ball or just “push” the ball into the goal is worth of a one-point goal).

***Comment:***
Both the spirit of the game of Beach Handball and its specific philosophy have to be respected.

There has to be space for "creative or spectacular goals", which will be awarded 2 points.

A goal is spectacular if it is of high technical standard and it is evidently not a "1-point goal", which is based on fundamental technical skills.

A remarkable and dramatic final action may lead to a creative goal.

Remark: If such goals clearly aim at "ridiculing" the opposing players, it shall be considered as unsportsmanlike conduct and shall never lead to a "2-point goal" (Fair Play).
