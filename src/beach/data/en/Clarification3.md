## 3. Free-throw execution after the final signal (Rule [2:10-12](#2:10))

In many cases, the team that has the opportunity to execute a free throw
after the playing time has expired is not really interested in trying to score a
goal either because the outcome of the game is already clear or because
the position for the free throw is too far away from the goal of the
opponents. Although technically the rules require that the free throw should
be executed, the referees should show good judgment and consider the
free throw taken if a player who is in the approximately correct position
simply lets the ball drop or hands it to the referees.

In those cases where it is clear that the team wants to try to score a goal,
the referees must try to find a balance between allowing this opportunity
(even though it is a very small one) and ensuring that the situation does not
deteriorate into a time-consuming and frustrating “theatre”. This means that
the referees should get the players from both teams into correct positions
firmly and quickly, so that the free throw can be executed without delay.
The players of the executing team must be admonished and monitored so
that only one player holds the ball. If players want to leave the court to be
substituted, they must do so at their own risk. The referees have no
obligation to wait for their execution signal until the substitutes are in their
correct positions.

The referees must also be very alert to punishable violations by both teams.
Persistent encroachment by the defenders must be punished (Rules [15:7](#15:7), [16:1c](#16:1), [16:2f](#16:2)). Moreover, the attacking players often violate the rules during
the execution. It is very important not to allow any goals scored illegally.
