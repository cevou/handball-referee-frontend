## 7. Definition of a “clear chance of scoring” (Rule [14:1](#14:1))

For the purposes of Rule [14:1](#14:1), a “clear chance of scoring” exists when:
- a) A player who already has ball and body control of the opponents at the
goal-area line has the opportunity to shoot on goal, without any
opponent being able to prevent the shot with legal methods;
- b) A player who has ball and body control is running (or dribbling) alone
towards the goalkeeper in a counter-attack, without any other opponent
being able to come in front of him and stop the counter-attack;
- c) A player is in a situation which corresponds to (a) or (b) above, except
that the player does not yet control the ball but is ready for an
immediate reception of the ball; the referees must be convinced that no
opponent will be able to prevent the reception of the ball with legal
methods;
- d) A goalkeeper has left his goal area and an opponent with ball and body
control has a clear and unimpeded opportunity to throw the ball into the
empty goal. (This applies also if defenders are in positions between the
throwing player and the goal, but the referees must then take into
account the possibility for these players to intervene in a legal manner.)
