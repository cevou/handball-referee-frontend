## The Throw-In

### 11:1
A throw-in is awarded when the ball has completely crossed the
sideline or when a court player on the defending team was the last
one to touch the ball before it crossed his teamâ€™s outer goal line.

## 11:2
The throw-in is taken without whistle signal from the referees (see, however, Rule [15:3b](#15:3)) by the opponents of the team whose player last
touched the ball before it crossed the line.

### 11:3
The throw-in is taken from the spot where the ball has crossed the
sideline, but at least 1 metre from the point where the goal-area line
and the sideline intersect if the ball has crossed the outer goal line or
sideline within the goal area.

### 11:4
The thrower must stand with a foot on the sideline until the ball has
left his hand. The player is not allowed to put the ball down and then
pick it up himself, or to bounce the ball and then catch it again himself
(Rule [13:1a](#13:1)).

### 11:5
The defending players must be at least 1 metre away from the
executing player during a throw-in.
