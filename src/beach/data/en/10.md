# The Referee Throw

### 10:1
Each period, and also the “Golden Goal”, begins with a referee throw (Rule [2:2](#2:2)).

### 10:2
The referee throw is taken in the centre of the court. One referee
throws the ball vertically following a whistle signal from the second
referee.

### 10:3
The second referee is positioned outside the sideline opposite the
timekeeping desk.

### 10:4
With the exception of one player of each team, all players must
remain at least three metres away from the referee while the referee
throw is being taken, but they are allowed to position themselves
anywhere else on the playing court.

The two players who are jumping for the ball shall stand next to the
referee, each on the side nearest to his own goal.

### 10:5 
The ball may be played only after it has reached its highest point.
