# Substitution Area Regulations

1. Each team has a substitution area for court players that is 15 metres
long and 3 metres wide. These areas are positioned on both sides of
the playing court outside the sideline (Rule [1:7](#1:7)).

2. No objects of any kind may be placed in the substitution areas. Water
bottles and towels may be kept in a device (e.g. branded box) provided
by the event management.


3. Only the players and team officials entered in the score sheet are
allowed to be in the substitution area (Rules [4:2](#4:2), [4:6](#4:6)).

4. Both teams are in the substitution area on their respective sides (Rules
[1:7](#1:7), [2:1](#2:1)).

   
5. The team officials in the substitution area must be fully dressed in
sportswear (Rule [4:8](#4:8), Comment).

   
6. If an interpreter is needed, he must take up a position behind the
substitution area

7. The timekeeper and scorekeeper as well as delegates shall support
the referees in monitoring the occupancy of the substitution area
before and during the game.

   If before the game there are any infringements of the rules regarding
the substitution area, the game may not start until the infringements
have been remedied. If these rules are infringed during the game, the
game may not be continued after the next interruption until the matter
has been resolved.

8. a)
 
   The team officials have the right and duty to guide and manage
their team also during the game, in a fair and sporting spirit within
the framework of the rules. In principle, they should sit or kneel in
their substitution area.

   However, one of the officials is **permitted** to move around within
the substitution area, specifically in order to:
    - Manage the substitution of players;
    - Give tactical advice to players on the court and in the
substitution area;
    - Give medical care;
    - Request a team time-out;
    - Communicate with the timekeeper/scorekeeper; this applies
only to the "responsible team official" and only in unusual
situations (Rule [4:6](#4:6)).

   At any given point in time, the permission to move around applies to
only one official per team. Moreover, the team official who is
moving must respect the limits of the substitution area as defined in
point no. 1 above.

   Similarly, the team official must also respect the need for
unrestricted vision on the part of the
timekeeper/scorekeeper/delegate.

   b) In principle, players in the substitution area should sit or kneel. The
substitute players are, however, permitted to move around in the
substitution area when they are soon going to enter the court, as
long as it is not done in a disturbing manner.

   c) It is **not permitted** for team officials or players to:
   - Interfere with or insult referees, delegates, timekeeper/
scorekeeper, players, team officials or spectators by behaving in
a provocative, protesting or otherwise unsportsmanlike manner
(speech, facial expression or gestures);
   - Leave the substitution area in order to influence the game;
   - Stand or move along the sideline while warming up.

   Team officials and players are generally expected to remain in the
substitution area of their team. If a team official nevertheless leaves the
substitution area for another position, he loses the right to guide and
manage his team and must return to the substitution area to regain his
right.

   More generally, players and team officials remain under the jurisdiction
of the referees/delegates throughout the game, and the normal rules for
personal punishments apply also if a player or official decides to take up 
a position away from the court and the substitution area. Therefore,
unsportsmanlike conduct, seriously unsportsmanlike conduct and
extremely unsportsmanlike conduct are to be punished in the same
manner as if the violation had taken place on the court or in the
substitution area.
9. If the Substitution Area Regulations are infringed, the referees are
obliged to act in accordance with Rules [16:1d](#16:1), [16:2c-d](#16:2) or [16:6b,e,h](#16:6)
(verbal warning, suspension, disqualification).
10. If the referees fail to notice an infringement of the Substitution Area
Regulations, they must be informed accordingly by the timekeeper/
scorekeeper/delegate during the next interruption of the game.
11. Intervention by the delegate(-s):

    Delegates from the IHF, a Continental or National Federation, who are
on duty in a game, have the right to inform the referees about a
possible decision in violation of the Rules (except in the case of a
referee decision on the basis of an observation of facts) or about a
violation of the Substitution Area Regulations.

    The delegate may interrupt the game immediately. In this case, the
game is restarted with a free throw for the team that did not commit the
violation that led to the interruption.

    If the interruption is caused by a violation committed by the defending
team and the interruption causes a clear scoring chance to be
destroyed, then a 6-metre throw in accordance with Rule [14:1a](#14:1) must be
awarded.

    The referees are obligated to give out personal punishments in
accordance with the instructions of the delegate.
   
    The facts related to a disqualification are to be reported in writing
(Rule [16:9](#16:9)).
