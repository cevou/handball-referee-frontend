# The Goalkeeper

**The goalkeeper is *allowed* to:**

### 5:1 
Touch the ball with any part of his body while in the act of defence
inside the goal area;

### 5:2
Move with the ball inside the goal area, without being subject to the
restrictions applying to court players (Rules [7:2-4](#7:2), [7:7](#7:7)). The
goalkeeper is not allowed, however, to delay the execution of the
goalkeeper throw (Rules [6:5](#6:5), [12:2](#12:2) and [15:3b](#15:3));

### 5:3
Leave the goal area without the ball and participate in the game in the
playing area; when doing so, the goalkeeper becomes subject to the
rules applying to players in the playing area;

The goalkeeper is considered to have left the goal area as soon as
any part of the body touches the sand outside the goal-area line.

### 5:4
Leave the goal area with the ball and play it again in the playing area,
if he has not managed to control it.

**The goalkeeper is *not allowed* to**:

### 5:5
Endanger the opponent while in the act of defence (Rules [8:2](#8:2), [8:5](#8:5));

### 5:6
Leave the goal area with the ball under control (free throw under
[13:1a](#13:1), if the referees have whistled for the execution of the
goalkeeper throw; otherwise the goalkeeper throw is simply repeated);

### 5:7
Touch the ball again outside the goal area following a goalkeeper
throw, until after it has touched another player (Rule [13:1a](#13:1));

### 5:8
Touch the ball when it is stationary or rolling on the sand outside the
goal area, while he is inside the goal area (Rule [13:1a](#13:1);

### 5:9
Take the ball into the goal area when it is stationary or rolling on the sand outside the goal area (Rule [13:1a](#13:1);

### 5:10
Re-enter the goal area from the playing area with the ball (Rule
[13:1a](#13:1);


### 5:11
Touch the ball with the foot or the leg below the knee, when it is
stationary on the sand in the goal area or moving out towards the
playing area (Rule [13:1a](#13:1);

## Substitution of the goalkeeper

### 5:12 
The goalkeeper is allowed to enter the playing court only over the
sideline of his own team’s goalkeeper‘s area and only from the side of
his own team’s substitution area (Rules [1:8](#1:8), [4:13](#4:13)).

The goalkeeper may leave the playing area over the sideline of his
own team‘s substitution area or the goal area (Rules [1:8](#1:8), [4:13](#4:13)), but
only on the side of his own team’s substitution area.
