# Hand Signals

## Guidelines

1. If 1 or 2 points are credited when a goal is scored (Rules [9](#9), [14:4](#14:4), [Clarification No. 1](#1.-awarding-of-points)), then the court referee must indicate this by displaying 1 or 2 fingers. When 2 points are awarded, the goal referee
does a full vertical arm swing additionally.
2. Hand Signal [12](#12---suspension): The referee indicates the rule violation and points
to the offending player.
A bent arm, grabbed at the wrist by the other arm, indicates a
suspension.
3. The referee uses a red card to indicate an “immediate”
disqualification.
4. Disqualifications must be clearly confirmed by a red card being held
in the air by the scorekeeper.
5. When a free throw or throw-in is called, the referees must show
immediately the direction for the throw that is to follow (Hand Signal
[7](#7---throw-in-–-direction) or [9](#9---free-throw-–-direction)).

   Thereafter, as applicable, the appropriate obligatory Hand Signal(s)
should be given to indicate any personal punishment (Hand Signals
[12](#12---suspension)-[13](#13---disqualification)).
 
   If it seems that it would also be useful to explain the reason for a free
throw or 6-metre throw decision, then the applicable one of Hand
Signals [1-6](#1---advantage) could be given for the sake of information.
6. Hand Signals [11](#11.1---gaining-1-point), [14](#14---time-out) and [15](#15---permission-for-two-persons-(who-are-entitled-to-participate)-to-enter-the-court-during-time-out) are mandatory in those situations where
they apply.
7. Hand Signals [8](#8---goalkeeper-throw), [10](#10---keep-the-distance-of-1-meter) and [16](#16---forewarning-signal-for-passive-play) are used as deemed necessary by the
referees.
