# Foreword

These Rules of the Game will take effect on 8 July 2014.

For the sake of simplicity, this rule book generally uses the male form of words with respect to female and male players, officials, referees and other persons.

However, the rules apply equally to both female and male participants, except Rule 3 (size of the ball).

**The Philosophy of Beach Handball is based on the principles of “Fair Play”. Every decision has to be taken in accordance with these principles.**

Fair Play means:
- Respect the health, integrity and body of the players.
- Respect the spirit and philosophy of the game.
- Respect the flow of the game, but never tolerate an advantage taken by violating the rules.
- Promote the spirit of true sportsmanship and pursue the cultural and athletic mission of the event.

According to the Philosophy of Beach Handball (attractiveness of the game – two teams playing as much as possible in full strength), any infringements awarded during play shall be against players as individuals and not team fouls.
