## 7. Intervention by the Timekeeper or a Delegate (18:1)

If the timekeeper or a delegate intervenes, when the game is already interrupted, then the
game is restarted with the throw that corresponds to the reason for the interruption.
If the timekeeper or a delegate intervenes, and thereby interrupts the game when the ball is in
play, then the following regulations apply:

### A. Faulty substitution or illegal entry by a player (Rules 4:2-3, 5-6)

The timekeeper (or delegate) must interrupt the game immediately, without regard for the
‘advantage’ concept under Rules 13:2 and 14:2. If due to such an interruption, due to violation
by the defending team, a clear chance of scoring is destroyed, then a 7-metre throw must be
awarded in accordance with Rule 14:1a. In all other cases, the game is restarted with a free
throw.

The guilty player is punished in accordance with Rule 16:3a. However, in the case of illegal
entry under Rule 4:6, during a clear chance of scoring, then the player is punished in
accordance with Rule 16:6b in conjunction with Rule 8:10b.

### B. Interruption for other reasons, e.g., unsportsmanlike conduct in the substitution area

#### 1. Intervention by the timekeeper
The timekeeper should wait until the next interruption in the game and then inform the
referee.

If nevertheless the timekeeper interrupts the game while the ball is in play, then the game is
restarted with a free throw for the team that was in possession at the time of the interruption.

If the interruption is due to a violation by the defending team, and thereby a clear chance of
scoring is destroyed, then a 7-metre throw must be awarded in accordance with Rule 14:1b.

(The same applies if the timekeeper interrupts the game due to a request for a team time-out,
and the referees refuse the team time-out because the timing is wrong. If a clear chance of
scoring is destroyed due to the interruption, then a 7-metre throw must be awarded).

The timekeeper does not have the right to pronounce a punishment against a player or a team
official. The same applies to the referees, if they have not themselves observed the violation.
In such a case, they can only give an informal caution. If the reported violation falls under
Rules 8:6 or 8:10, they must submit a written report.

#### 2. Intervention by a delegate
Delegates from the IHF, a continental confederation or a national federation, who are on duty
in a game, have the right to inform the referees about a possible decision in violation of the
rules (except in the case of a referee decision on the basis of an observation of facts) or about
a violation of the substitution area regulations.

The delegate may interrupt the game immediately. In this case, the game is restarted with a
free throw for the team that did not commit the violation that led to the interruption.
If the interruption is caused by a violation from the defending team, and the interruption
causes a clear scoring chance to be destroyed, then a 7-metre throw in accordance with Rule
14:1a must be awarded.

The referees are obligated to give out personal punishments in accordance with the
instructions of the delegate.

The facts related to a violation of Rules 8:6 or 8:10 are to be reported in writing.
