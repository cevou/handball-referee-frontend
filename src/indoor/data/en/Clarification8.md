# 8. Injured Player (4:11)
If a player seems to be injured on the court, the following measures have to be taken:

- a) If the referees are absolutely sure that the injured player needs medical treatment on
  the field, they will immediately show the hand signals no. 15 and 16. Thus, the player
  has to meet the regulations of Rule 4:11 2nd paragraph after receiving treatment.
  
  In all the other cases, the referees will ask the player to go out to receive treatment
  outside the court. If this is not possible for the player concerned, the referees will show
  the hand signals no. 15 and 16. Rule 4:11, 2nd paragraph is applicable.
  
  Infractions of these regulations will be punished due to unsportsmanlike conduct.
  
  If a player, who has to leave the playing court during three attacks, is punished with a
  2-minute suspension, he is allowed to re-enter the court at the end of this suspension,
  regardless of the number of attacks played.
  
  If team officials refuse to provide the necessary treatment of a player, the ‘responsible
  team official’ is to be punished progressively (see Rule 4:2, 3rd paragraph).
- b) The timekeeper and the scorekeeper or the delegates are responsible for counting the
  number of attacks. They inform the team concerned as soon as the player is allowed to
  re-enter the court.
  
  An attack starts with the possession of the ball and ends when a goal is scored or the
  team in attack loses the ball.
  
  If the team is in possession of the ball when its player needs treatment, this attack is
  considered as the first attack.
- c) Rule 4:11 2nd paragraph does not apply in the following cases:
  - if the required treatment of injury on the playing court is the result of an illegal
    action by an opposing player who has been punished progressively by the referees;
  - if the goalkeeper’s head is hit by a ball and treatment inside the court is necessary
