## 2. Time-Out (2:8)

Apart from the situations indicated in Rule 2:8, where a time-out is obligatory, the referees are
expected to use their judgment regarding the need for time-outs also in other situations. Some
typical situations where time-outs are not obligatory but nevertheless tend to be given in
normal circumstances are:

- a) there are external influences, e.g. the court must be wiped;
- b) a player seems to be injured;
- c) a team is clearly wasting time, e.g. when the team is delaying the execution of a formal
  throw, or when a player is throwing the ball away or not releasing it;
- d) if the ball touches the ceiling or a fixture above the court (11:1), and the ball is
  deflected so that it goes far away from the location of the resulting throw-in, causing
  an unusual delay;
- e) replacing a court player with a goalkeeper in order to execute a goalkeeper throw.

When determining the need for a time-out in these and other situations, the referees should
foremost take into consideration whether an interruption of the game without a time-out
would create an unfair disadvantage for one of the teams. For instance, if a team is leading by
a very clear margin late in the game, then it might not be necessary to make a time-out during
a brief interruption to wipe the court. Similarly, if the team that would be disadvantaged by
the lack of a time-out is the team that, for some reason, is itself causing a delay or wasting
time, then there is obviously no reason for a time-out.

Another important factor is the expected duration of the interruption. The length of an
interruption caused by an injury is often difficult to estimate, so it may then be safer to call a
time-out. Conversely, the referees should not be too quick to call a time-out just because the
ball has left the playing court. In such cases the ball is often back and ready to be played
almost immediately. If not, the referees should concentrate on getting a reserve ball into play
quickly (3:4), precisely in order to make a time-out unnecessary.

The obligatory time-out in connection with 7-metre throws has been removed. It may still be
necessary to give a time-out based on subjective judgment on some occasions, in accordance
with the principles just discussed. This may involve situations where one of the teams clearly
delays the execution, including for instance through a substitution of the goalkeeper or the
thrower.
