# Guidelines for Playing Courts and Goals

- a) The playing court (diagram 1) consists of a rectangle which measures 40 x 20m. It
  should be checked by measuring the length of the two diagonals. From the outer side
  of one corner to the outside of the opposite corner they should measure 44.72m. The
  length of the diagonals for one half of the court should measure 28.28m from the
  outside of each of the corners to the opposite outer middle of the centre line.
  
  The playing court is provided with marking lines which are called “lines”. The width
  of the goal lines (between the goalposts) is 8cm like the goalposts, all other lines have
  a width of 5cm. Lines which separate adjacent areas of the playing court can be
  replaced by a change in colours between the adjacent areas.

- b) The goal area in front of the goals consists of a 3 x 6m rectangle and two connecting
  quarter circle sectors each with a radius of 6m. It is constructed by drawing a 3m long
  line parallel to the goal line at a distance of 6m from the rear edge of the goal line to
  the front edge of the goal-area line. On both sides this line continues in two quartercircle
  arcs with the centre at the rear inside edge of the respective goalposts and with a
  radius of 6m. The lines and arcs which enclose the goal area are called the goal area
  line. The outer distance between the points where the two arcs meet the outer goal line
  in this way will measure 15m (diagram 5).
- c) The broken free throw line (9m line) is made parallel and concentric to the goal-area
  line with a 3m larger distance from the goal line. The segments as well as the spaces
  between them measure 15cm. The segments should be cut off right-angled and radially
  respectively. The measurements of the curved segments are taken over the outer chord
  (diagram 5).
- d) The 1m long 7-metre line is drawn directly in front of the goal, parallel to the goal
  line, at a distance of 7m from the rear edge of the goal line to the front edge of the 7m
  line (diagram 5). 
- e) The goalkeeper’s restraining line (the 4m line) directly in front of the goal is 15cm
  long. It is parallel to, and 4m away from, the goal line measured from the rear edge of
  the goal line to the front edge of the 4m line, which means that the widths of both lines
  are included in this measure.
- f) The playing area should be surrounded by a safety zone of at least 1m along the side
  line  s and 2m behind the outer goal lines.
- g) The goal (diagram 2) is placed in the centre of each outer goal line. The goals must be
  firmly attached to the floor or to the wall behind them. The interior measures are 3m in
  width and 2m in height. The goal frame must be a rectangle, which means that the
  inside diagonals will measure 360.5cm (max. 361cm – min. 360cm, in one and the
  same goal the difference must be maximum 0.5cm).
  
  The rear side of the goalposts shall be in line with the rear edge of the goal line (and
  the outer goal line), which means that the front side of the goalposts is placed 3cm in
  front of the outer goal line.
  
  The goalposts and the horizontal crossbar which joins them shall be made of a uniform
  material (e.g. wood, light metal or synthetic material) and have a square cross section
  of 8cm with rounded edges with a rounding radius of 4±1mm. On the three sides
  which are visible from the court, the goalposts and the crossbar must be painted in
  bands of two colours which contrast clearly with each other and with the background;
  the two goals on one and the same playing court must have the same colours.
  
  The colour bands of the goals measure in the corner between posts and bar 28cm in
  each direction in the same colour. All other colour bands shall be 20cm long. The
  goals must have a net, called goal net, which must be attached in such a way that a ball
  thrown into the goal cannot immediately rebound or pass through the goal. If
  necessary, an additional net, placed in the goal behind the goal line can be used. The
  distance from the goal line to this additional net should be approximately 70cm, but
  minimum 60cm.
- h) The depth of the goal net should at the top be 0.9m behind the goal line, and at the
  bottom 1.1m, both measures with a tolerance of ± 0.1m. The size of the meshes should
  not be more than 10 x 10cm. The net must be fixed to the post and the crossbar at least
  at every 20cm. It is allowed to bind together the goal net and the additional net in such
  a way that no ball can go between the two nets.
- i) Behind the goal in the middle of the outer goal line at a distance of approximately
  1.5m, there should be a vertical barrage net with a length of 9 - 14m and a height of
  5m from the floor.
- j) In the middle of the substitution area at one of the side lines the table for the
  timekeeper is placed. The table of a length of max. 4m should be placed 30-40cm
  above the floor of the playing court in order to secure the field of vision.
- k) All measurements without specification of a tolerance must correspond to the ISONorm
  (International Standard Organization -ISO 27681:1989).
- l) Handball goals are standardised by the European Committee for Standardization, CEN
  (Comité Européen de Normalisation) as EN 749 in connection with EN 202.10-1.
