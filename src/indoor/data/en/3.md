***Comment:***

*The technical requirements for the balls to be used in all official international games are
described in the “IHF Ball Regulations”.*

*The size and weight of balls to be used for “Mini-Handball” are not regulated in the normal
playing rules.*

### 3:3 
For every game there must be at least two balls available. The reserve balls must be
immediately available at the timekeeper’s table during the game. The balls must meet
the requirements of Rules [3:1-2](#3:1).

### 3:4 
The referees decide when to use a reserve ball. In such cases, the referees should get the
reserve ball into play quickly in order to minimise interruptions and avoid time-outs.
