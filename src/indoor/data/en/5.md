# The Goalkeeper

**The goalkeeper is *allowed* to:**

### 5:1 
touch the ball with any part of his body while in the act of defence inside the goal area;

### 5:2
move with the ball inside the goal area, without being subject to the restrictions
applying to court players (7:2-4, [7:7](#7:7)); the goalkeeper is not allowed, however, to delay
the execution of the goalkeeper throw (6:4-5, [12:2](#12:2) and 15:5b);

### 5:3
leave the goal area without the ball and participate in the game in the playing area; when
doing so, the goalkeeper becomes subject to the rules applying to players in the playing
area (except in the situation described in Rule [8:5](#8:5) Comment, 2nd paragraph).
The goalkeeper is considered to have left the goal area as soon as any part of the body
touches the floor outside the goal-area line.

### 5:4
leave the goal area with the ball and play it again in the playing area if he has not
managed to control it.

**The goalkeeper is *not allowed* to**:

### 5:5
endanger the opponent while in the act of defence ([8:3](#8:3), [8:5](#8:5), [8:5](#8:5) Comment, 13:1b);

### 5:6
leave the goal area with the ball under control; this leads to a free throw (according to
[6:1](#6:1), 13:1a and [15:7](#15:7), 3rd paragraph), if the referees had whistled for the execution of the
goalkeeper throw; otherwise the goalkeeper throw is simply repeated ([15:7](#15:7), 2nd
paragraph); see, however, the advantage interpretation in [15:7](#15:7), if the goalkeeper were
to lose the ball outside the goal area after having crossed the line with the ball in his
hand.

### 5:7
touch the ball when it is stationary or rolling on the floor outside the goal area, while he
is inside the goal area ([6:1](#6:1), 13:1a);

### 5:8
take the ball into the goal area when it is stationary or rolling on the floor outside the
goal area ([6:1](#6:1), 13:1a);

### 5:9
re-enter the goal area from the playing area with the ball ([6:1](#6:1), 13:1a);

### 5:10
touch the ball with the foot or the leg below the knee, when it is moving out towards the
playing area (13:1a);

### 5:11
cross the goalkeeperâ€™s restraining line (4-metre line) or its projection on either side,
before the ball has left the hand of the opponent who is executing a 7-metre throw
([14:9](#14:9)).

***Comment:***

*As long as the goalkeeper keeps one foot on the floor on or behind the restraining line (4-
metre line), he is permitted to move the other foot or any other part of his body out over the
line in the air.*
