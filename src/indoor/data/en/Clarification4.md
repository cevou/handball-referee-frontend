## 4. Passive Play (7:11-12)

### A. General Guidelines

The application of the rules regarding passive play has the objective of preventing unattractive
methods of play and intentional delays in game. This requires that the referees throughout the
game recognise and judge passive methods in a consistent manner.

Passive methods of play may arise in all phases of a team’s attack, i.e. when the ball is moved
down the court, during the build-up phase, or during the finishing phase.

Passive ways of playing are typically used more frequently in the following situations:
- a team is narrowly in the lead towards the end of the game;
- a team has a player suspended;
- when the ability of the opponent is superior, especially on defence.

The criteria mentioned in the following specifications rarely apply alone, but must generally
be judged in their entirety by the referees. In particular, the impact of active defensive work in
conformity with the rules must be taken into account.

### B. The Utilisation of the Forewarning Signal 

The forewarning signal should be shown particularly in the following situations:

#### B1. Forewarning signal when substitutions are made slowly or when the ball is moved slowly down the court

Typical indications are:

- players are standing around in the middle of the court waiting for substitutions to be
  completed;
- a player is delaying the execution of a free throw (by pretending not to know the
  correct spot), a throw-off (by a slow recovery of the ball by the goalkeeper, by an
  intentionally erratic pass to middle, or by slow walking with the ball to the middle), a
  goalkeeper throw, or a throw-in, after the team has previously been admonished to
  refrain from such delaying tactics;
- a player is standing still bouncing the ball;
- the ball is played back into the team’s own half of the court, even though the
  opponents are not putting on any pressure.
  
#### B2. Forewarning signal in connection with a late substitution during the build-up phase 

Typical indications are:

- all players have already taken up their attacking positions;
- the team starts the build-up phase with a preparatory passing play;
- not until this stage does the team undertake a substitution.

***Comment:***

*A team which has attempted a rapid counter-attack from its own half of the court, but has
failed to get to an immediate scoring opportunity after reaching the opponents’ half of the
court, must be allowed to undertake a quick substitution of players at that stage.*

#### B3. During an excessively long build-up phase

In principle, a team must always be allowed a build-up phase with a preparatory passing play
before they can be expected to start a targeted attacking situation.

Typical indications of an excessively long build-up phase are:

- the team’s attack does not lead to any targeted attacking action;

***Comment:***

*A targeted attacking action exists particularly when the team in ball possession uses tactical
methods to move in such a way that they gain spatial advantage over the defenders, or when
they increase the pace of the attack in comparison with the build-up phase.*

- players are repeatedly receiving the ball while standing still or moving away from the
  goal;
- repeated bouncing of the ball while standing still;
- when confronted by an opponent, the attacking player turns away prematurely, waits
  for the referees to interrupt the game, or gains no spatial advantage over the defender;
- active defensive actions: active defensive methods preventing the attackers from
  increasing the pace because the defenders block the intended ball movements and
  running paths;
- a special criterion for excessively long build-up phases is when the attacking team
  achieves no clear increase in pace from the build-up phase to the finishing phase.

### How the Forewarning Signal should be used 

If a referee (either the court referee or the goal-line referee) recognises the emergence of
passive play, he lifts the arm (hand signal no.17), to indicate the judgment that the team is not
trying to get into a position to take a shot on goal. The other referee should also give the
forewarning signal.

The forewarning signal conveys that the team in possession is not making any attempt to
create a scoring opportunity, or that it is repeatedly delaying the restart of the game.
The hand signal is maintained until:

- the attack is over, or
- the forewarning signal is no longer valid (see comments below).

An attack begins when the team gets into possession of the ball, and is considered over when
the team scores a goal or loses possession.

The forewarning signal normally applies for the entire remainder of the attack. However,
during the course of an attack, there are two situations where the judgment of passive play is
no longer valid, and the forewarning signal is to be stopped:

1) the team in possession takes a shot on goal and the ball rebounds directly to the
   attacking team from the goal or the goalkeeper, or results in a throw-in for that team;
2) a player or team official of the defending team is given a personal punishment under
   Rule 16 due to a foul or unsportsmanlike conduct.
   
In these two situations, the team in possession must be allowed a new build-up phase.

## D. After the Forewarning Signal has been shown

After showing the forewarning signal, the referees should allow the team in possession of the
ball some time to change their action. In this regard, the skill level in different age and
performance categories must be taken into account.

The team forewarned should thus be allowed the possibility to prepare a targeted attacking
action towards the goal.

If the team in possession does not make a recognisable attempt to get into position to take a
shot on goal (decision-making criteria see D1 and D2), then one of the referees decides that
this is passive play at the latest when no shot on goal is executed after 6 passes (7:11-12).

The following actions are not considered as passes:

- If an attempted pass cannot be controlled due to a penalised foul by a defending player.
- If an attempted pass is deflected by a defending player out over the side line or the outer goal line.
- A throwing attempt that is blocked by the opponent.

***Decision-making** criteria after showing the forewarning signal:*

#### D1. The attacking team:
- no clear increase in pace;
- no targeted action towards the goal;
- 1-on-1 actions where no spatial advantage is achieved;
- delays when playing the ball (e.g., because the passing routes are blocked by the defending team).

#### D2. The defending team:
- the defending team tries to prevent an increase in pace or a targeted attacking action,
  through correct and active defensive methods;
- if the defending team tries to interrupt a pass sequence of the attacking team by
  committing infractions in accordance with Rule 8:3, this behaviour has to be
  consistently punished progressively.
  
#### D3. Notes concerning the maximum number of passes

##### D3a. Before the execution of the 6th pass:
- If the referees decide a free throw or a throw-in to the attacking team when the
  forewarning signal has been shown, it does not interrupt the count of passes.
- Similarly if a pass or a shot on goal is blocked by a court player of the defending team
  and the ball goes to the attacking team (even as a goalkeeper throw), it does not
  interrupt the count of passes.
  
##### D3b. After the execution of the 6th pass:
- If a free throw, a throw-in (or a goalkeeper throw) is awarded to the attacking team
  after the 6th pass, the team has the possibility of combining a throw with one
  additional pass to finish the attack.
- The same applies if the throw executed after the 6th pass is blocked by the defending
  team and the ball is directed to an attacking player or passes the side line or the outer
  goal line. In this case, the attacking team has the possibility of finishing the attack by
  making one additional pass.
  
### E. Appendix

**Indications of a reduction of pace**

- Action sideways and not in depth towards the goal
- Frequent diagonal running in front of the defenders without putting any pressure on them
- No action in depth, such as confronting an opponent 1-on-1 or passing the ball to
  players between the goal-area line and the free throw line
- Repeated passing between two players with no clear increase of pace or actions
  towards the goal
- Passing of the ball with all positions involved (wing players, pivot and back-court
  players) with no clear increase of pace or recognisable actions towards the goal

**Indications of 1-on-1 actions where no spatial advantage is gained**

- 1-on-1 action in a situation where it is obvious that there is no room for a breakthrough
  (several opponents block the room for a break-through.)
- 1-on-1 action without any aim to break through towards the goal
- 1-on-1 action with the objective of simply being awarded a free throw (e.g., letting
  oneself ‘get stuck’, or ending the 1-on-1 action even though it might have been
  possible to break through)

**Indications of active defensive methods in conformity with the rules**

- Trying not to commit a foul, so as to avoid an interruption in the game
- Obstructing the running path of the attacker, perhaps by using two defenders
- Moving forward to block the passing routes
- Defenders moving forward to force the attackers further back in the court
- Provoking attackers to pass the ball far back into harmless positions
