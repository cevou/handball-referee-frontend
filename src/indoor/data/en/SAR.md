## Substitution Area Regulations

1. The substitution areas are situated outside the sideline, to the left and right of the extension
   of the centre line, up to end of the respective team benches (compatible with row of chairs,
   which is also permitted), and also behind them if there is space (Rules of the Game:
   diagram 1).
  
   The regulations for IHF and continental confederation events/competitions prescribe that
   the team benches, and thereby also the respective ‘coaching zones’, shall start at a distance
   of 3.5 metres from the centre line. This is also a recommendation for games at all other
   levels.
  
   No objects of any kind may be placed at the side line in front of the team benches (for at
   least 8 metres from the centre line).

2. Only the players and team officials entered in the score sheet are allowed to be in the
   substitution area (4:1-2).

   If an interpreter is needed, he must take up a position behind the substitution area.

3. The team officials in the substitution area must be fully dressed in sportswear or civilian
   clothing. Colours which may cause confusion with the court players of the opposing team
   are not allowed. 

4. The timekeeper and scorekeeper shall support the referees in monitoring the occupancy of
   the substitution area before and during the game.
  
   If before the game there are any infringements of the rules as regards the substitution area,
   the game must not start until the infringements have been remedied. If these rules are
   infringed during the game, the game must not be continued after the next interruption until
   the matter has been resolved.
   
5. The team officials have the right and duty to guide and manage their team also during the
   game, in a fair and sporting spirit within the framework of the rules. In principle, they
   should sit on the team bench.
  
   However, the officials are *permitted* to move around within the ‘coaching zone’. The
   ‘coaching zone’ is the area directly in front of the bench and, if this is feasible, also
   directly behind it.
  
   The movements and the positioning in the ‘coaching zone’ are allowed for the purposes of
   giving tactical advice and to provide medical care. In principle, only one official of the
   team is allowed to stand or move at a time. However, his position or his behaviour shall
   not interfere with the actions of the players who are on the court. In case of an infraction of
   these regulations, the official is to be punished progressively.
   
   It is, of course, permitted for one team official to leave the ‘coaching zone’ when he
   immediately wants to submit the ‘green card’ to request a team time-out. However, the
   team official is not allowed to leave the ‘coaching zone’ with the ‘green card’ and stand
   waiting at the table for the moment to request the team time-out.
   
   The ‘responsible team official’ may also leave the ‘coaching zone’ in special situations, for
   instance, for necessary contact with the timekeeper or scorekeeper.
   In principle, players in the substitution area should sit on the substitution bench.
   
   The players are however *permitted* to:
   - move around behind the bench to warm up, without ball, provided that there is
     sufficient space and that it is not disruptive.
   
   It is *not permitted* for team officials or players to:
   - interfere with or insult referees, delegates, timekeeper/scorekeeper, players, team
     officials, or spectators, by behaving in a provocative, protesting, or otherwise
     unsportsmanlike manner (speech, facial expression or gestures);
   - leave the substitution area in order to influence the game.
     
   Team officials and players are generally expected to remain in the substitution area of their
   team. If a team official nevertheless leaves the substitution area for another position, he
   loses the right to guide and manage his team and he must return to the substitution area to
   regain his right.
   
   More generally, players and team officials remain under the jurisdiction of the referees
   throughout the game, and the normal rules for personal punishments apply also if a player
   or official decides to take up a position away from the court and the substitution area.
   Therefore, unsportsmanlike conduct, seriously unsportsmanlike conduct, and extremely
   unsportsmanlike conduct are to be punished in the same manner as if the violation had
   taken place on the court or in the substitution area. 
   
6. If the Substitution Area Regulations are infringed, the referees or the delegates are obliged
   to act in accordance with the Rules 4:2 3rd paragraph, 16:1b, 16:3d-f or 16:6b-d (warning, suspension,
   disqualification).
