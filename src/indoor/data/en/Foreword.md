# Foreword

These Rules of the Game will take effect on 1 July 2016.

The Rules Text, the Comments, the IHF Hand Signals, the Clarifications to the Rules of the
Game, and the Substitution Area Regulations are all components of the overall rules.

Please also note the integrated “Guidelines and Interpretations” that give additional
guidance on the application of certain rules. The former version published in 2010 with
updates is no longer valid. The “Guidelines and Interpretations” will be expanded, if
required.

The “Guidelines for Playing Courts and Goals”, which are simply included in the rule book
for the convenience of the users of that text, are not an integral part of the rules.

***Note:***

*For the sake of simplicity, this rule book generally uses the male form of words with respect
to players, officials, referees and other persons.*

*However, the rules apply equally to male and female participants, except as regards the rules
for the size of the balls to be used (see Rule 3).*
