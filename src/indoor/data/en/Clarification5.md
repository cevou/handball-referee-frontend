## 5. Throw-Off (10:3)

As a guiding principle for the interpretation of Rule 10:3, the referees should keep in mind the
objective of encouraging teams to make use of a quick throw-off. This means that the referees
should avoid being pedantic and should not search for opportunities to call back or penalise a
team trying to throw quickly.

For instance, the referees must avoid letting note-taking or other tasks interfere with their
readiness to check the player positions quickly. The court referee should be ready to whistle at
the very moment when the thrower reaches the correct position, assuming that there is no
clear need for corrections of other player positions. The referees must also keep in mind that
the teammates of the thrower are allowed to move across the centre line as soon as the whistle
is blown. (This is an exception from the basic principle for the execution of formal throws.)

Although the rule states that the thrower must step on the centre line and be within 1.5 metre
from the centre, the referees should not be excessively precise and concerned about
centimetres. The main thing is to avoid unfairness and uncertainty for the opponents regarding
when and where the throw-off is taken.

Moreover, most courts do not have the centre point marked, and some courts may even have
the centre line interrupted due to advertising at the centre. In such cases, both the thrower and
the referee will obviously need to estimate the correct position, and any insistence on
exactness would then be unrealistic and inappropriate.
