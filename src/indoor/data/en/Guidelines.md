# Guidelines and Interpretations  

## Replacement of players and officials (Rules 4:1 – 4:2)

In the event that a team has not exhausted the maximum number of players (Rule 4:1) or
officials (Rule 4:2) permitted, it is allowed:

- to register someone as an official who was initially registered as a player
- to register someone as a player who was initially registered as an official

The maximum number of players and officials respectively must not be exceeded.

The player’s or the official’s original function shall be deleted in the match report. It is not
permitted to replace a player or an official in his original function which has meanwhile been
deleted. Furthermore it is not allowed to delete a participant having a certain function in order
to make a substitution in compliance with the maximum number permitted. It is not allowed
to register a person as both a player and an official.

The IHF, the continental confederations and the national federations have the right to apply
deviating regulations in their areas of responsibility.

Personal punishment resulting from changing the function (warning, suspension) shall be
considered for both the personal quota and the ‘player’ and ‘official’ quota respectively. 

## Markings of the playing court (Rule 1, Substitution Area Regulations Section 1)

The restraining line of the ‘coaching zone’ is provided for information purposes.
This line is 50 cm long and is drawn at a distance of 350 cm (outside the court, parallel to the
centre line). It begins at a distance of 30 cm at the outside of the side line (recommended
dimensions).

## Team Time-Out (Rule 2:10, Clarification No. 3)
The start of the last five minutes of the playing time begins when the clock indicates 55:00 or
05:00.

## Substitution of players (Rule 4:4)
Players shall always leave and enter the court over their own team’s substitution line. Injured
players who leave the court when playing time was interrupted are exempted.

Those players must not be forced to leave the court over the substitution line, where it is
obvious that they need medical treatment inside the substitution area or in the changing
rooms. Furthermore the referees should allow the substitute player to enter the court before
the injured player has left the court in order to keep interruption to a minimum.

## Additional players (Rule 4:6, 1st paragraph)

If an additional player enters the court without a substitution, there shall be a 2-minute
suspension for the player.

If it is not possible to identify the guilty player, the following steps shall be taken:
- The delegate or the referees respectively advise the ‘responsible team official’ to name the
  guilty player.
- The named player shall receive the 2-minute suspension as a personal punishment.
- In the event that the ‘responsible team official’ refuses to name the guilty player, the
  delegate or the referees respectively shall name a player. The named player shall receive a 2-
  minute suspension as a personal punishment.

***Note:***
- *Only players who are on the court at the time of the game interruption may be named the ‘guilty player’.*
- *In case the ‘guilty player’ receives the third suspension, he shall be disqualified according to Rule 16:6d*

## Forbidden objects, helmets, face and knee protections (Rule 4:9)
All types and sizes of face masks and helmets are forbidden. Not only full masks but also
masks to cover parts of the face are forbidden.

As far as knee protections are concerned, it is not permitted to wear metallic parts. The plastic
objects must be entirely padded.

As far as ankle joint protections are concerned, all hard parts made of metal or plastic must be
covered.

Elbow protection is allowed only if made of soft material.

Federations and referees are not allowed to grant any exceptions. However, if a responsible
team official addresses a delegate or a referee in case of doubt, they will make a decision on
the basis of the regulations of Rule 4:9 as well as the “Guidelines”. In this context, being “not
dangerous” and giving “no improper advantage” are the most important principles.

This decision was taken in coordination with the Medical Commission of the IHF.

For additional advice (recommended actions for referees and technical delegates), see
appendix 1 and appendix 2.

## Glue (Rule 4:9)
It is permitted to use glue. It is permitted to deposit glue on the shoes. This does not endanger
the opponent’s health.

However, it is not permitted to deposit glue on the hands or the wrist. This endangers the
opponents’ health, as glue might come into their eyes or their face. According to Rule 4:9 this
practice is not allowed.

National federations have the right to adopt additional restrictions for their area.

## Assisting injured players (Rule 4:11)
In cases where several players of the same team have been injured e.g. due to a collision, the
referees or the delegate may give permission for additional eligible persons to enter the court
in order to assist those injured players. Moreover the referees and the delegate monitor
paramedics who may enter the court.

## Injured goalkeeper (Rule 6:8)
The goalkeeper is hit by a ball in play and is incapable of acting. Generally in these cases the
protection of the goalkeeper must be given priority. In terms of restarting the game different
situations are possible:

- a) The ball passes the side line, the outer goal line, or is lying or rolling inside the goal
  area.
  
  Correct application of Rules: Immediate interruption of play, throw-in or goalkeeper
  throw in relation to the above cases, should be implemented to restart the game.
- b) The referees interrupted the game before the ball passed the side line or the outer goal
  line or before the ball was lying or rolling inside the goal-area.
  
  Correct application of Rules: Restarting the game with the throw that corresponds to
  the situation.
- c) The ball is in the air over the goal area.
  
  Correct application of Rules: Wait one or two seconds until one team gains possession
  of the ball, interrupt the game, restart the game with a free throw for the team in
  possession of the ball.
- d) The referee whistles in a moment when the ball is still in the air.
  
  Correct application of Rules: Restart the game with a free throw for the team that last
  has been in possession of the ball.
- e) The ball bounces from the goalkeeper incapable of acting back to an attacking player.
  
  Correct application of Rules: Interrupt the game immediately; restart the game with a
  free throw for the team in possession of the ball.
  
***Note:***

*In such cases a 7m throw is never possible. The referees interrupted the game
deliberately for the protection of the goalkeeper. Therefore it is not a question of an
‘unwarranted whistle’ according to Rule 14:1b.*

## Steps, start dribbling (Rule 7:3)
In compliance with Rule 7:3c,d putting down your foot for the first time after receiving the
ball during a jump is not considered as a step (zero contact). However, ‘ball reception’ means
receiving a pass.

Dribbling and catching the ball in the air during a jump is not considered as ‘ball reception’
according to the rule. Putting down your foot after dribbling has started is therefore without
exception considered as a step.

## Counting the number of passes after the forewarning signal (7:11)
See training support in appendix 3.

## Intervention by additional players or officials (Rules 8:5, 8:6, 8:9, 8:10b)
In cases where additional players or officials intervene, the decision on punishment and
continuation of play are subject to the following criteria:
- player or official
- destroying a clear chance of scoring

Due to the named criteria the following situations could occur:
a) During a clear chance of scoring an additional player who has not been involved
- in a substitution process is present on the court.
  
  Correct application of Rules: 7m throw, disqualification to be reported in writing
- b) Incorrect substitution: The timekeeper/delegate whistles during a clear chance of
  scoring.
  
  Correct application of Rules: 7m throw, 2min suspension.
- c) During a clear chance of scoring a team official enters the court.
  
  Correct application of Rules: 7m throw, disqualification to be reported in writing.
- d) As under c), but no clear chance ofscoring.
  
  Correct application of Rules: free throw, progressive punishment.

## Further measures after a disqualification to be reported in writing (Rules 8:6, 8:10a, b)
The criteria for this highest level of punishment are defined in Rules 8:6 (for illegal
behaviour) and 8:10 (for unsportsmanlike behaviour); see also Rule 8:3 section 2.

As the consequences of a punishment according to rule 8:6 or 8:10, during the game, do not
differ from the penalty according to rules 8:5 and 8:9 (disqualification not to be reported in
writing) the IHF added the following supplementary provision to both rules:
“... they must submit a written report after the game, so that the responsible authorities are in a
position to take a decision about further measures.”

This supplementary provision builds the principle for the responsible authority to decide
about the intended further measures. Not at all the wording of the rule “... are in position” may
be interpreted as a discretion of the responsible authority, if further measures are taken. This
would mean a change of fact-finding of the referees. Any enhancement of the disqualification
punishment should not be reported in writing as intended by the IHF, and therefore is no
longer necessary.

## Criteria for disqualification not to be reported / to be reported in writing (Rules 8:5, 8:6)
The following criteria assist in distinguishing between Rule 8:5 and Rule 8:6:
- a) What defines ‘particularly reckless’?
  - assaults and assault-similar actions
  - ruthless or irresponsible actions without any sense of proper behaviour
  - unrestrained hitting
  - malevolent actions
- b) What defines ‘particularly dangerous’?
  - actions against an unprotected opponent
  - extremely risky and serious actions endangering the opponent’s health
- c) What defines ‘premeditated action’?
  - intentional and deliberately committed malicious action
  - wilful action against the body of the opponent just to destroy the opponent’s action
- d) What defines ‘malicious action’?
  - sneaky and hidden action against the unprepared opponent
- e) What defines ‘without any relation to the game situation’?
  - actions committed far away from the player in possession of the ball
  - actions without any relation to game tactics

## Court player entering the goal area (8:7f)
If a team is playing without a goalkeeper and loses the ball, a court player of this team who is
entering the team’s own goal area to gain an advantage is to be punished progressively.

## Spitting (Rules 8:9, 8:10a)
Spitting at someone is considered an assault-similar action and must be punished in
accordance with 8:10a (disqualification to be reported in writing). Differentiation between
‘successful spitting’ (punishment according to Rule 8:10) and ‘unsuccessful spitting’ (attempt,
punishment according to Rule 8:9), which was previously introduced, remains unchanged.

## Last 30 seconds (Rules 8:10c, 8:10d)
The last 30 seconds of the game occur during regular playing time (end of 2nd half) as well as
at the end of the second half during both overtime periods. The start of the last 30 seconds of
the game begins when the clock indicates 59 minutes 30 seconds (or 69:30, 79:30) or 0
minutes 30 seconds.

## Not respecting the distance (Rule 8:10c)
“Not respecting the distance” only leads to a disqualification + 7m throw, if a throw during
the last 30 seconds of the game (!) cannot be executed.

If the throw is executed and blocked by a player standing too close, normal progressive
punishment shall be applied during the last 30 seconds of the game too, as the ball has left the
hand of the thrower (see Rule 15:2 1st paragraph).

The Rule is applicable if the infraction is committed during the last 30 seconds of the game
or at the same time as the final signal (see Rule 2:4, 1
st paragraph). In this case, the referees
will make a decision on the basis of their observations of facts (Rule 17:11).

If the game is interrupted during the last 30 seconds due to an interference that is not directly
related to the preparation or the execution of a throw (for example faulty substitution,
unsportsmanlike conduct in the substitution area), Rule 8:10c is to be applied.

## Disqualification during the last 30 seconds (Rule 8:10d)
In case of a disqualification of a defending player according to Rules 8:5 and 8:6 during the
last 30 seconds of the game, only infractions according to Rule 8:6 Comment lead to a
disqualification to be reported in writing + 7m throw. Infractions of a defending player
according to Rule 8:5 during the last 30 seconds of the game lead to a disqualification not to
be reported in writing + 7m throw.

## Gaining an advantage during the last 30 seconds (8:10d, last paragraph)
The referees interrupt the game and award a 7m at the latest when the player receiving a pass
does not score a goal or continues the game by making another pass.

Rule 8:10d is applicable if the infraction is committed during the playing time or at the same
time as the final signal (see Rule 2:4, 1st paragraph). In this case, the referees will make a
decision on the basis of their observations of facts (Rule 17:11).

A disqualification of the goalkeeper according to Rule 8:5 Comment (Leaving the goal area)
leads to a 7m throw during the last 30 seconds of the game if the conditions according to Rule
8:5, last paragraph, are fulfilled or an infraction is committed according to Rule 8:6. 

## Throw-in execution (Rule 11:4)
A throw-in is executed in the direction of the playing court as direct throw passing the side
line.

## Execution of a throw (Rule 15)
Rule 15:7, 3rd paragraph and Rule 15:8 include examples of possible faults when executing a
throw. Dribbling and putting the ball down on the floor (before taking it up again) is an
infraction, as well as having the ball in contact with the floor when executing a throw
(exception: goalkeeper throw).

In this case, faults are also to be treated according to the regulations of Rule 15:7 and 15:8
(correction or punishment).

## Disqualified players / officials (Rule 16:8)
Disqualified players and officials must leave the court and the substitution area immediately
and must not have any contact with their team afterwards.

In cases where the referees recognise another infraction committed by a disqualified player or
official, after restarting the game, must be reported in writing.

It is not possible, however, to extend further punishments in the game against the player or
official concerned, and therefore, their behaviour must not lead to a reduction in the number
of players on the court. This is also valid in the event that a disqualified player enters the
court.

## Spectators behaving in a way to endanger players (Rule 17:12)
Rule 17:12 is also to be applied if spectators are behaving in a way to endanger players, for
example by using a laser pointer or throwing different type of objects. In this case, the
following measures are to be taken:

- if necessary, the game is suspended immediately and is not continued;
- the spectators are asked to stop disturbing the game;
- if necessary, spectators are removed from the corresponding stands and the game is
  only re-started when all spectators concerned have left the hall;
- the home team is asked to take additional safety measures;
- written report.

If the game has already been suspended when detecting the irregularity, Rule 13:3 (by
analogy) is applicable.

If the game is suspended at the time of a clear chance of scoring, Rule 14:1c is applicable.
In all the other cases, a free throw has to be awarded to the team having been in possession of
the ball from the spot where the ball was when play was interrupted.
