## 1. Free-Throw Execution after the Final Signal (2:4-6)
In many cases, the team that has the opportunity to execute a free throw after the playing time has expired is not
really interested in trying to score a goal, either because the outcome of the game is already clear or because the
position for the free throw is too far away from the goal of the opponents. Although technically the rules require that
the free throw be executed, the referees should show good judgment and consider the free throw taken if a player who is
in the approximately correct position simply lets the ball drop or hands it to the referees.

In those cases where it is clear that the team wants to try to score a goal, the referees must try to find a balance
between allowing this opportunity (even though it is a very small one) and ensuring that the situation does not
deteriorate into a time-consuming and frustrating “theatre”. This means that the referees should get the players from
both teams into correct positions firmly and quickly so that the free throw can be executed without delay. The new
restrictions in Rule [2:5](#2:5) regarding player positions and substitutions must be enforced ([4:5](#4:5) and
[13:7](#13:7)).

The referees must also be very alert to other punishable violations by the two teams. Persistent encroachment by the
defenders must be punished ([15:4](#15:4), [15:9](#15:9), [16:1b](#16:1), [16:3d](#16:3)). Moreover, the attacking
players often violate the rules during the execution, e.g. one or more players cross the free throw line after the
whistle but before the throw ([13:7, 3rd paragraph](#13:7)), or the thrower actually moves or jumps when throwing
([15:1](#15:1), [15:2](#15:2), [15:3](#15:3)).

It is very important not to allow any goals scored illegally
