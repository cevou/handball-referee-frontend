## 6. Definition of “Clear Chance of Scoring” (14:1)

For the purposes of Rule 14:1, a clear chance of scoring exists when:

- a) a player who already has ball and body control at the goal-area line of the opponents
  has the opportunity to shoot on goal, without any opponent being able to prevent the
  shot with legal methods.
  
  This also applies if the player does not yet have the ball but is ready for an immediate
  reception of the ball; there must not be an opponent in a position to prevent the
  reception of the ball with legal methods.
- b) a player who has ball and body control is running (or dribbling) alone towards the
  goalkeeper in a counter-attack, without any other opponent being able to come in front
  of him and stop the counter-attack.
  
  This also applies if the player does not yet have the ball but is ready for an immediate
  reception of the ball, and the opposing goalkeeper through a collision as under 8:5
  Comment prevents the reception of the ball; in this special case, the positions of the
  defending players are irrelevant.
- c) a goalkeeper has left his goal area and an opponent with ball and body control has a
  clear and unimpeded opportunity to throw the ball into the empty goal.
