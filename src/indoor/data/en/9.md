# Scoring

### 9:1
A goal is scored when the entire ball has completely crossed the goal line (see diagram
4), provided that no violation of the rules has been committed by the thrower, a
teammate or a team official before or during the throw. The goal line referee confirms
with two short whistle signals and hand signal no. 12 that a goal has been scored.

A goal shall be awarded if there is a violation of the rules by a defender but the ball still
goes into the goal.

A goal cannot be awarded if a referee, timekeeper or delegate has interrupted the game
before the ball has completely crossed the goal line.

A goal shall be awarded to the opponents if a player plays the ball into his own goal,
except in the situation where a goalkeeper is executing a goalkeeper throw (12:2, 2nd
paragraph).

***Comment:***

*A goal shall be awarded if the ball is prevented from going into the goal by someone or
something not participating in the game (spectators, etc.), and the referees are convinced that
the ball would otherwise have entered the goal.*

### 9:2
A goal that has been awarded can no longer be disallowed, once the referee has blown
the whistle for the subsequent throw-off to be taken. (See, however, Rule 2:9 Comment).

The referees must make clear (without a throw-off) that they have awarded a goal, if the
signal for the end of a half sounds immediately after a goal is scored and before a
throw-off can be taken.

***Comment:***
*A goal should be entered on the scoreboard as soon as it has been awarded by the referees.*

### 9:3
The team that has scored more goals than the opponents is the winner. The game is tied
if both teams have scored the same number of goals or no goals at all (see 2:2).
