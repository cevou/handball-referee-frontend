**Additional advice on face masks ban and other objects not allowed (Rule 4:9)**

The IHF-PRC regularly receives requests for a statement or even for granting exceptions
regarding certain kinds of face masks, although additional notes included in the Guidelines
and Interpretations applicable explicitly indicate the total ban on the use of face masks.

Generally speaking the main argument of the questioner or the applicant is a corresponding
personal judgment saying that the face mask concerned, usually with corresponding pictures
documented, does not pose a danger to the players’ health. Nevertheless the IHF Medical
Commission indicated all types and sizes of face masks in their recommendation about the
ban on such equipment. Thus there would be no room for interpretation even if the face mask
concerned did not pose a danger to others.

However, it is reported from time to time that individual clubs or players referring to the
alleged non-existence of danger to others intend defying the named ban on the use of face
masks to cause additional problems in the decision-making process for referees and Technical
Delegates officiating in the relevant match.

Due to the aforementioned the IHF-PRC herewith releases the following recommendations
including the attached scheme for referees and timekeepers or technical delegates respectively
in order to amend the provisions stipulated in Rules 4:9 and 17:3, 2nd paragraph, and the
statements included in the Guidelines and Interpretations applicable.

**A player wearing a face mask intends participating in the game!**

The measures to be decided by the referees mainly depend on the moment in time of the first
and, when applicable, the follow-up identification.

In case the infraction is identified for the first time, the guilty player and ‘responsible team
official’ A shall basically be advised of the ban on the use of face masks. The guilty player
shall be told to correct the problem and will only be allowed to participate in the game if the
deficiency is corrected. If the player is advised for the first time, he shall not be given a
personal/progressive punishment.

If a player is unrepentant despite appropriate advice, the first follow-up identification is
warranted as more severe unsportsmanlike conduct and must be punished with a 2-minute
suspension in accordance with 8:8a (exception for rule-specific reasons, see situation 1.2 as
below). In addition the player is invited again to correct the problem.

Should the infraction be identified a second time, it will be considered as seriously
unsportsmanlike conduct, and the guilty player shall receive a disqualification (without being
reported) in accordance with 8:9.

In the opinion of the IHF-PRC the following scenarios, which in parts might indeed be
rather hypothetical - may occur:

1.1 If the infraction in accordance with 4:9 is recognised before the start of the game (during
the warm-up), the player and ‘responsible team official’ A are advised of the ban in
accordance to 17:3, 2nd paragraph).

The player shall be told to remove his face mask (Rule 4:9; Guidelines and Interpretations).
The player and ‘responsible team official’ A shall be advised that in case such infraction of
4:9 occurs a second time it shall be considered as unsportsmanlike behaviour according to
17:5, 2nd paragraph, and the introduction of 8:7, to result into progressive punishment for the
player in accordance with 8:8a or 8:9.

1.2 In the event that the player wearing a face mask enters the playing court at the start of the
match anyway, the match shall not be started.
The guilty player shall be given a warning according to 16:11, 2nd paragraph, point a.
The player with the face mask must leave the playing court.
He may only participate in the game if the problem is corrected.

1.3 In the event that the player wearing a face mask enters the playing court during the match,
the referees or the timekeeper/Technical Delegate respectively must give a time- out to
interrupt the match immediately due to the potential risk of endangering others.
In accordance with 8:8 a (provocative behaviour) the guilty player shall be punished with a
2min suspension (16:3 f).
The player must then leave the playing court to correct the problem.
The player will be allowed to participate in the match again after expiration of his 2-minute
suspension and after having corrected the problem.
The match shall be restarted with a free-throw for the opposing team according to 13:1a (7-
metre throw in case the match was interrupted at the time of a clear scoring chance (14:1a).

1.4 In the event that the player wearing a face mask enters the court a second time during the
match, the referee or the timekeeper/Technical Delegate respectively must give a time-out to
interrupt the match immediately due to the potential risk of endangering others.
The player's repeated misconduct is considered as seriously unsportsmanlike conduct in
accordance with 8:9.
The player shall be disqualified in accordance with 16:6 b.
The provisions laid down in 16:7 and 16:8, paragraphs 1 – 4, are to be observed.
The match shall be restarted with a free-throw for the opposing team according to 13:1 a (7m
throw in case the match was interrupted at the time of a clear scoring chance (14:1a).

2.1 In the event that the infraction is not recognised or identified by the referees before the
start of the game (during the warm-up), a player who is on the court when the match is started
shall be told to correct the problem according to 4:9.
The match must not be started as long as the guilty player is on the court.
The player and ‘responsible team official’ A are advised that in case such infraction of 4:9
occurs a second time it shall be considered as unsportsmanlike conduct according to 17:5, 2nd
paragraph, and the introduction of 8:7, to result into progressive punishment for the player in
accordance with 8:8a or 8:9.
Then the throw-off shall be taken as usual (10:1, 1st paragraph).

2.2 In the event that the player wearing a face mask enters the playing court during the match
with the infraction previously not being noticed or recognised by the referees or
timekeeper/Technical Delegate respectively, a time-out shall be decided to interrupt the match
immediately due to the potential risk of endangering others.
The player shall be told to correct the problem in accordance with 4:9.
The player and ‘responsible team official’ A are advised that in case such infraction of 4:9
occurs a second time it shall be considered as unsportsmanlike behaviour according to 17:5,
2nd paragraph, and the introduction of 8:7, to result into progressive punishment for the player
in accordance with 8:8a or 8:9.
The match shall be restarted with a free throw for the opposing team according to 13:1 a (7m
throw in case the match was interrupted at the time of a clear scoring chance (14:1a).

2.3 In the event that the player wearing a face mask enters the court again despite the
aforementioned advice, the referees or the timekeeper/Technical Delegate respectively shall
give a time-out to interrupt the match immediately due to the potential risk of endangering
others.
In accordance with 8:8 a (provocative behaviour) the offending player shall receive a 2min
suspension (16:3 f).
The player must then leave the playing court to correct the problem.

suspension and after having corrected the problem.
The match shall be restarted with a free-throw for the opposing team according to 13:1 a (7m
throw in case the match was interrupted at the time of a clear scoring chance (14:1a).

2.4 In the event that the player wearing a face mask enters the court again during the game,
the referees or the timekeeper/Technical Delegate respectively shall give a time-out to
interrupt the game immediately due to the potential risk of endangering others.
The player's repeated misconduct is considered as seriously unsportsmanlike conduct in
accordance to 8:9.
The player shall be disqualified according to 16:6 b.

The provisions laid down in 16:7 and 16:8, paragraphs 1 – 4, shall be observed.
