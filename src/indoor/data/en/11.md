## The Throw-In

### 11:1
A throw-in is awarded when the ball has completely crossed the side line, or when a
court player of the defending team was the last one to touch the ball before it crossed his
teamâ€™s outer goal line.

It is also awarded when the ball has touched the ceiling or a fixture above the court.

## 11:2
The throw-in is taken without whistle signal from the referees (see, however, 15:5b) by
the opponents of the team whose player last touched the ball before it crossed the line or
touched the ceiling or fixture.

### 11:3
The throw-in is taken from the spot where the ball crossed the side line or, if it crossed
the outer goal line, from the intersection of the side line and the outer goal line on that
side.

For a throw-in after the ball touched the ceiling or a fixture above the court, the throwin
is taken at the nearest point on the nearest side line in relation to the spot where the
ball touched the ceiling or fixture.

### 11:4
The thrower must stand with a foot on the side line and remain in a correct position until
the ball has left his hand. There is no limitation for the placement of the second foot
(13:1a, 15:6, 15:7 2nd and 3rd paragraph).

### 11:5
While the throw-in is being taken, the opponents may not be closer than 3 metres to the
thrower (15:4, 15:9, 8:7c).

This does not apply, however, if they stand immediately outside their own goal-area
line.
