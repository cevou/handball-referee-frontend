## 3. Team Time-Out (2:10)
Each team has the right to receive one 1-minute team time-out in each half of the regular
playing time (but not in overtime).

A team that wishes to request a team time-out must do so by having a team official place a
green card on the table in front of the timekeeper. It is recommended that the green card
measures about 15 x 20 cm and has a large “T” on each side.

A team may request their team time-out only when it has possession of the ball (when the ball
is in play or during an interruption). Provided that the team does not lose possession before
the timekeeper has time to whistle (in which case the green card would be returned to the
team), the team will be granted the team time-out immediately.

The timekeeper then interrupts the game by blowing the whistle, and stops the clock (2:9). He
gives the hand signal for time-out (no. 15) and points with a stretched arm at the team that
requested the team time-out.

The green card is placed on the table, on the side of the team that requested the team time-out,
and remains there during the time-out.

The referees acknowledge the team time-out, and the timekeeper starts a separate clock
controlling the duration of the team time-out. The scorekeeper enters the time of the team
time-out in the score sheet for the team that requested it.

During the team time-out the players and team officials remain at the level of their
substitution areas, either on the court or in the substitution area. The referees stay in the centre
of the court, but one of them may briefly go to the timekeeper’s table for consultation.

For the purpose of punishments under Rule 16, a team time-out is defined as being part of the
playing time (16:10), so any unsportsmanlike conduct and other infractions are punished in
the normal way. It is irrelevant in this context, if the player/official concerned is on or off the
court. Accordingly, a warning, suspension or disqualification under Rules 16:1-3 and 16:6-9
can be given for unsportsmanlike conduct (8:7-10) or for action falling under Rule 8:6b.

After 50 seconds the timekeeper gives an acoustic signal indicating that the game is to be
continued in 10 seconds.

The teams are obliged to be ready to resume play when the team time-out expires. The game
is restarted either with the throw that corresponds to the situation that existed when the timeout
was granted or, if the ball was in play, with a free throw for the team requesting the team
time-out from the place where the ball was at the time of the interruption.

When the referee blows the whistle the timekeeper starts the clock.

***Note:***

*If the IHF, continental confederations or national federations apply deviating regulations
according to the Note under Rule 2:10, each team has the right to receive a maximum of three
team time-outs during regular playing time but not during overtime. No more than two team
time-outs may be granted in each half of the regular playing time. Between two team timeouts
of a team, the opponent must be at least once in possession of the ball. 3 green cards,
bearing numbers 1, 2, and 3 respectively, are available for each team.*

*The teams receive cards bearing numbers ‘1’ and ‘2’ in the first half of the game and the
cards no. 2 and no. 3 in the second half provided they received no more than one team timeout
in the first half. In case they received two team time-outs in the first half, they receive only
green card no. 3.*

*Within the last five minutes of the regular playing time only one team time-out per team is
allowed.*
